    </p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed (about 4 cups)</li>

        <li>1 onion, cut into 8 wedges</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>4 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons harissa paste</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>

        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream, or as needed</li>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Here's step by step guide!</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>

        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss butternut squash, onion, 
            and whole garlic with olive oil. Spread out on the prepared baking sheet.
        </p>

        <li>Step 2</li>

        <p>
            Roast in the preheated oven until tender and slightly caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </p>

        <li>Step 3</li>

        <p>
            Place cooked vegetables into the jar of a blender. If ingredients are hot, fill blender no more than halfway
            full, and hold lid down with a potholder. You may have to work in batches. Add broth, harissa paste, cumin, 
            smoked paprika, and brown sugar. Blend until smooth
        </p>

        <li>Step 4</li>

        <p>
            Pour blender contents into a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 10 
            minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Stir in heavy cream and season with salt and pepper. Ladle 
            into bowls and serve with a swirl of heavy cream, if desired.
